# Blockchain

This repository contains multiple blockchain projects, including proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) with proof-of-history (PoH) consensus algorithms.

## Projects
- `blockchain-pow`: A blockchain project implementing the PoW consensus algorithm. This project uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate a cryptographic proof-of-work, and is designed to be highly resistant to tampering and fraud.
- `blockchain-pos-poh`: A blockchain project implementing a hybrid consensus algorithm using PoS and proof-of-history (PoH). This project uses PoS for block validation and PoH for block ordering, and takes inspiration from the efficient implementation of the Solana blockchain to achieve high scalability and energy-efficiency in distributed processing.

## Usage
Each project can be built and run independently by following the instructions in their respective README files.
