# Generic blockchain(with PoW)
Blockchain = chronological, sequential list of blocks

## 1. Blocks & hashing
block & block chain? linked list or linked array. 
   
Blocks contain this informs:
- Index: this block's location within the list of blocks
- Payload: any relevant information or events that have
- Timestamp: gives our blockchain a sense of time
- Nonce: special number used for mining (for PoW verification)
- Previous block hash: cryptographic fingerprint of previous block
- Hash: cryptographic fingerprint of all of the above data concatenated together

### Hashing?(digital fingerprint)
In a nutshell, a hash algorithm consists of a set of irreversible computations 
that can be performed on a datum to generate a (usually) unique byte sequence.
In a blockchain, each block contains a set of transactions and
a reference to the previous block's hash. The current block's hash is calculated by
applying the hash function to the combination of the block's transactions and
the previous block's hash. This creates a chain of hashes that is resistant to tampering,
as any change in the block data will result in a different hash.
`SHA2`, `SHA3(Keccak-256)`

### Why Rust?

- Interoperable with C/C++
- smart compiler
- Strict but safe and fast type system(monomorphism)
- Simple GC
- "Pointers" are always safe. even multi thread env
